abstract = {Five of the most recent observational methods to estimate anthropogenic CO2 (Cant) are applied to a highquality dataset from five representative sections of the Atlantic Ocean extending from the Arctic to the Antarctic. Between latitudes 60° N-40° S all methods give similar spatial distributions and magnitude of Cant. However, discrepancies are found in some regions, in particular in the Southern Ocean and Nordic Seas. The differences in the Southern Ocean have a significant impact on the anthropogenic carbon inventories. The calculated total inventories of Cant for the Atlantic referred to 1994 vary from 48 to 67 Pg (1015 g) of carbon, with an average of 54±8 Pg C, which is higher than previous estimates. These results, both the detailed Cant distributions and extrapolated inventories, will help to evaluate biogeochemical ocean models and coupled climate-carbon models.},

abstract = {We present full 2004-2005 seasonal cycles of CO2 partial pressure (pCO2) and dissolved oxygen (O2) in surface waters at a time series site in the central Labrador Sea (56.5°N, 52.6°W) and use these data to calculate annual net air-sea fluxes of CO2 and O2 as well as atmospheric potential oxygen (APO). The region is characterized by a net CO2 Sink (2.7 ± 0.8 mol CO2 m-2 yr-1) that is mediated to a major extent by biological carbon drawdown during spring/summer. During wintertime, surface waters approach equilibrium with atmospheric CO2. Oxygen changes from marked undersaturation of about 6{\%} during wintertime to strong supersaturation by up to 10{\%} during the spring/summer bloom. Overall, the central Labrador Sea acts as an O2 Sink of 10.0 ± 3.1 mol m-2 yr-1. The combined CO2 and O2 sink functions give rise to a sizable APO flux of 13.0 ± 4.0 mol m-2 yr-1 into surface waters of the central Labrador Sea. A mixed layer carbon budget yields a net community production of 4.0 ± 0.8 mol C m-2 during the 2005 productive season about one third of which appears to undergo subsurface respiration in a depth range that is reventilated during the following winter. The timing of the spring bloom is discussed and eddies from the West Greenland Current are thought to be associated with the triggering of the bloom. Finally, we use CO2 and O2 mixed layer dynamics during the 2005 spring bloom to evaluate a suite of prominent wind speed-dependent parameterizations for the gas transfer coefficient. We find very good agreement with those parameterizations which yield higher transfer coefficients at wind speeds above 10 m s-1. Copyright 2008 by the American Geophysical Union.},

abstract = {Abstract On the mean, ocean carbon uptake is linked to biological productivity, but how biological variability impacts carbon uptake is poorly quantified. Our ability to diagnose past change, understand present variability, and predict the future state of the global carbon cycle requires improving mechanistic understanding in this area. Here we make use of colocated pCO2 and temperature data, a merged surface ocean color product, and physical fields from an ocean state estimate to assess relationships between surface ocean biology and the carbon cycle on seasonal, monthly anomaly, and interannual timescales over the period 1998–2014. Using a correlation analysis on spatial scales from local to basin-scale biomes, we identify the timescales on which ocean productivity could be directly modifying ocean carbon uptake. On seasonal timescales outside of the equatorial Pacific, biome-scale correlations are negative between chlorophyll and pCO2. Though this relationship is pervasive, the underlying mechanisms vary across timescales and biomes. Consistent with previous findings, biological activity is a significant driver of pCO2 seasonality only in the subpolar biomes. For monthly anomalies acting on top of the mean seasonality, productivity and pCO2 changes are significantly correlated in the subpolar North Pacific and Southern Ocean. Only in the Southern Ocean are correlations consistent with a dominant role for biology in the surface ocean carbon cycle on all timescales.},

@article{Fontela2020,
abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2020, The Author(s). The oceanic uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide (CO2) emitted by human activities alters the seawater carbonate system. Here, the chemical status of the Northeast Atlantic is examined by means of a high-quality database of carbon variables based on the GO-SHIP A25 section (1997–2018). The increase of atmospheric CO2 leads to an increase in ocean anthropogenic carbon (Cant) and a decrease in carbonate that is unequivocal in the upper and mid-layers (0–2,500 m depth). In the mid-layer, the carbonate content in the Northeast Atlantic is maintained by the interplay between the northward spreading of recently conveyed Mediterranean Water with excess of carbonate and the arrival of subpolar-origin waters close to carbonate undersaturation. In this study we show a progression to undersaturation with respect to aragonite that could compromise the conservation of the habitats and ecosystem services developed by benthic marine calcifiers inhabiting that depth-range, such as the cold-water corals (CWC) communities. For each additional ppm in atmospheric pCO2 the waters surrounding CWC communities lose carbonate at a rate of − 0.17 ± 0.02 $\mu$mol kg−1 ppm−1. The accomplishment of global climate policies to limit global warming below 1.5–2 ℃ will avoid the exhaustion of excess carbonate in the Northeast Atlantic.},

@article{Perez2010,
abstract = {A high-quality inorganic carbon system database, spanning over three decades (1981-2006) and comprising of 13 cruises, has allowed the applying of the C ° T method and coming up with estimates of the anthropogenic CO 2 (C ant) stored in the main water masses of the North Atlantic. In the studied region, strong convective processes convey surface properties, like C ant, into deeper ocean layers and grants this region an added oceanographic interest from the point of view of air-sea CO 2 exchanges. Generally, a tendency for decreasing C ant storage rates towards the deep layers has been observed. In the Iberian Basin, the North Atlantic Deep Water has low C ant concentrations and negligible storage rates, while the North Atlantic Central Water in the upper layers shows the largest C ant values and the largest annual increase of its average concentration (1.13 ± 0.14 $\mu$mol kg -1 yr -1). This unmatched rate of change in the C ant concentration of the warm upper limb of the Meridional Overturning Circulation decreases towards the Irminger basin (0.68 ± 0.06 $\mu$mol kg -1 yr -1) due to the lowering of the buffering capacity. The mid and deep waters in the Irminger Sea show rather similar C ant concentration rates of increase (between 0.33 and 0.45 $\mu$mol kg -1 yr -1), whereas in the Iceland basin these layers seem to have been less affected by C ant. Overall, the C ant storage rates in the North Atlantic subpolar gyre during the first half of the 1990s, when a high North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) phase was dominant, are ∼48{\%} higher than during the 1997-2006 low NAO phase that followed. This result suggests that a net decrease in the strength of the North Atlantic sink of atmospheric CO 2 has taken place during the present decade. The changes in deep-water ventilation are the main driving processes causing this weakening of the North Atlantic CO 2 sink. {\textcopyright} 2010 Author(s).},

The original measurements of K1 and K2 reported by Mehrbach et al. [Mehrbach, C., Culberson, C.H., Hawley, J.E., Pytkowicz, R.M., 1973. Measurement of the apparent dissociation constants of carbonic acid in seawater at atmospheric pressure. Limnol. Oceanogr. 18, 897-907] are reformulated to give equations for pK1 and pK2 (pK = - log10 K) as a function of seawater temperature and salinity, consistent with the 'total hydrogen ion' concentration scale: pK1 = 3633.86/T - 61.2172 + 9.67770lnT - 0.011555 S + 0.0001152 S2 pK2 = 471.78/T + 25.9290 - 3.16967lnT - 0.01781 S + 0.0001122 S2. By equilibrating solutions of seawater with gas mixtures of known composition, we demonstrate that the above formulations of K1 and K2 give calculated fCO2 values that agree with equilibrated values to 0.07 ± 0.50{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval, fCO2 up to 500 $\mu$atm). Formulations of K1 and K2 based on other studies resulted in calculated fCO2 values approximately 10{\%} lower than the measurements. Equilibrations at fCO2 above 500 $\mu$atm yielded measured fCO2 values higher than calculated values by on average 3.35 ± 1.22{\%} (95{\%} confidence interval). The cause for the fCO2 dependence of the results is not known. The uncertainties in pK1 and pK2 were combined with the analytical uncertainties typical of contemporary measurements of DIC and TA to reveal the expected reliability of seawater fCO2 calculated from these parameters. For example, an uncertainty of 1.0 $\mu$mol kg-1 in DIC and 2 $\mu$mol kg-1 in TA (1 standard deviation (s.d.)) will result in uncertainty of the calculated fCO2 of 1{\%} or ± 3.5 $\mu$atm at 350 $\mu$atm (1 s.d.).

abstract = {Pairs of marine carbonate system variables are often used to calculate others, but those results are seldom reported with estimates of uncertainties. Although the procedure to propagate these uncertainties is well known, it has not been offered in public packages that compute marine carbonate chemistry, fundamental tools that are relied on by the community. To remedy this shortcoming, four of these packages were expanded to calculate sensitivities of computed variables with respect to each input variable and to use those sensitivities along with user-specified estimates of input uncertainties (standard uncertainties) to propagate uncertainties of calculated variables (combined standard uncertainties). Sensitivities from these packages agree with one another and with analytical solutions to within 0.01{\%}; similar agreement among packages was found for the combined standard uncertainties. One package was used to quantify how propagated uncertainties vary among computed variables, seawater conditions, and the chosen pair of carbonate system variables that is used as input. The relative contributions to propagated uncertainties from the standard uncertainties of the input pair of measurements and various other input data (equilibrium constants etc) were explored with a new type of diagram. These error-space diagrams illustrate that further improvement beyond today's state-of-the-art measurement uncertainties for the input pair would generally be ineffective at reducing the combined standard uncertainties because the contribution from the constants is larger. Likewise, using much more uncertain measurements of the input pair does not always substantially worsen combined standard uncertainty. The constants that contribute most to combined standard uncertainties are generally K1 and K2, as expected. Yet more of the propagated uncertainty in the computed saturation states of aragonite and calcite comes from their solubility products. Thus percent relative combined standard uncertainties for the saturation states are larger than for the carbonate ion concentration. Routine propagation of these uncertainties should become standard practice.},
